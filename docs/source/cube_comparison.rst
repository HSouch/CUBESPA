Comparing Two Datacubes
=======================

Comparing two different datacubes is an important step for any analysis, whether it is cubes from a different 
cleaning algorithm (the PHANGs pipeline vs a manual CASA cleaning, for example), 
or different momemt mask parameters,
or cubes cleaned with different parameters, seeing how these cubes compare directly with one another is 
extremely important.

To get started comparing two cubes, one uses the ``CubeComparison`` object.
